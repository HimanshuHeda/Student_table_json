**Student Table JSON**
**Project Description**
The Student Table JSON project is designed to store and manage student data in a structured JSON format. This JSON file can be used in various applications, such as web apps, backend services, or data processing scripts, to retrieve and manipulate student information in a lightweight and flexible way.

**Features**
Structured Data: Organizes student information in a readable and standardized JSON format.
Portable: Easily used with JavaScript, Python, and other programming languages that support JSON.
Scalable: New data fields and student records can be added without altering the structure significantly.
JSON Structure
The JSON file consists of an array of objects, each representing a student with the following fields:

**json**
[
    {
        "studentID": "S001",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "age": 21,
        "department": "Computer Science",
        "email": "johndoe@example.com",
        "GPA": 3.8,
        "courses": ["Algorithms", "Data Structures", "Networking"]
    },
    {
        "studentID": "S002",
        "name": "Jane Smith",
        "age": 22,
        "department": "Mathematics",
        "email": "janesmith@example.com",
        "GPA": 3.6,
        "courses": ["Calculus", "Statistics", "Linear Algebra"]
    }
]

**Key Fields**
**studentID:** Unique identifier for each student (String).
**name:** Full name of the student (String).
**age:** Age of the student (Integer).
**department:** Department or field of study (String).
**email:** Contact email address (String).
**GPA:** Grade Point Average (Decimal).
**courses:** Array of courses the student is enrolled in (Array of Strings).

**Example Usage**
To retrieve or display student data, parse the JSON object with your preferred programming language. For example:

**JavaScript**
javascript
// Fetch and parse JSON data
fetch('path/to/students.json')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));

**Python**
python
import json

# Load JSON data
with open('students.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Access student information
print(data)
Adding New Student Data
To add a new student, add an additional object in the JSON array:

**json**
{
    "studentID": "S003",
    "name": "Alice Brown",
    "age": 20,
    "department": "Physics",
    "email": "alicebrown@example.com",
    "GPA": 3.9,
    "courses": ["Quantum Mechanics", "Thermodynamics"]
}

**Contributing**
Feel free to contribute by adding new fields, improving data validation, or updating the structure to accommodate additional student-related information.
